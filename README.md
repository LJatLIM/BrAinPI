# BrAinPI

BrAinPI, pronounced "Brain Pie", is a Flask-based API for serving a variety of multiscale imaging data for access over the web in standard file formats like ome-zarr and neuroglancer precomputed. BrAinPI provides a file browser interface that allows one to expose a file system with basic user and group management. The browser interface can be used for single click access to neuroglancer/openseadragon visualizations.  When multiscale chunked imaging file types are available (see "Compatible file types" below), BrAinPI can open the dataset in neuroglancer/openseadragon or provide links to various 'views' of the data structured as ome-zarr. The ome-zarr links are compatible with any application that support ome-zarr, including neuroglancer and napari.



## Installing BrAinPI

```bash
# Currently, BrAinPI has only been tested on Ubuntu >=16.04

conda create -y -n brainpi python=3.8
conda activate brainpi

git clone https://github.com/CBI-PITT/BrAinPI.git
pip install -e /path/to/cloned/repo/
# Using conda to install glymur for jp2 images
conda install -c conda-forge glymur=0.13.6

## Before running BrAinPI

'''
Edit the settings_TEMPLATE.ini and groups_TEMPLATE.ini files and rename them to settings.ini and groups.ini.
On limux machine, test the files allowed to be opened by ulimit -n. Increase it using ulimit -n 500000 if it's default 1024.
'''

```



## Running BrAinPI and Neuroglancer:

```bash
# For development:
# BrAinPI Start
python /path/to/cloned/repo/brainapi/brain_api_main.py
# Neuroglancer Start
python /path/to/cloned/repo/brainapi/neuroglancer_server.py

# In production:
# BrAinPI Start
gunicorn --worker-class gevent -b 0.0.0.0:5001 --chdir /path/to/cloned/repo/BrAinPI wsgi:app -w 24 --threads=2 --worker-connections=20
# Neuroglancer Start
python /path/to/cloned/repo/brainapi/neuroglancer_server.py
## Adjust these parameters according to your specific needs
# -w = workers (suggest the number of logical CPUs)
# -threads = threads per worker (suggest 2)
# --worker-connections (suggest 5-20)
### We suggest running BrAinPI behind NGINX in a production environment.
```



## Access BrAinPI:

```python
# If running BrAinPI on your local computer

# BrAinPI Browser:
http://localhost:5001:/browser

# HTML links endpoint:
# Returns a json with links to several versions of a dataset on disk
http://localhost:5001/path_to_html_options/?path=/path/to/physical/location/on/disk
```

| OME-Zarr-like | [Alternative Zarr Stores](https://github.com/CBI-PITT/zarr_stores) | BrAinPI can read datasets structured like OME-Zarr but not conforming strictly to the OME-NGFF specification. Currently supported are datasets written in alternative zarr storage classes (supported: H5_Nested_Store) |

| Jp2           | [Library used to read](https://github.com/quintusdias/glymur) | glymur requires openjpeg pre-installed on your system and in the standard location if using pip to install the project. You can install it using conda to avoid this if you do not have administator rights. 1. pip uninstall glymur 2. conda install -c conda-forge glymur
| Nii/Nii.gz/Nii.zarr| [Library used to read](https://github.com/neuroscales/nifti-zarr) | It's still under activaly development.

## "File Browser:

A file browsing interface is availabe in BrAinPI at the "/browser" endpoint. At the root of the file browser, paths registered with BrAinPI appear according to their assigned names.  Paths exposed for anonymous visitors to BrAinPI can be made under [dir_anon].  Paths that should only be seen by authenticated users can be registered via [dir_auth]. 



NOTE: Although paths are not exposed and browseable when registered with [dir_auth], links generated against files in these paths can be viewed by anyone.

NOTE: Currently LDAP authentication can be configured only for windows active directory.



In the examples below, the root of the browser path by anonymous browsers would show 'my_fav_location' 

```ini
# settings.ini
[dir_anon]
my_fav_location = /path/to
open_s3_bucket = s3://bucket_name

[dir_auth]
another_place = /another
```



## "path_to_html_options" endpoint:

This endpoint makes it easy to retrieve links to several views of a compatible file type.  For this to work, the settings.ini file must have a path registered that you wish to expose to BrAinPI in either the [dir_anon] or [dir_auth] fields. The user then passes the full file path to the endpoint to determine if BrAinPI is capable of translating the dataset. A json file is returned with several entries described in the table below. Null values indicate that BrAinPI is not able to generate a link for that dataset - or the path does not exist.

<u>Examples for how to structure a request (see setting.ini above):</u>

http://localhost:5001/path_to_html_options/?path=/path/to/physical/location/on/disk.ims<br/>
http://localhost:5001/path_to_html_options/?path=/another/path/to/a/different/physical/location/on/disk.ome.zarr<br/>
